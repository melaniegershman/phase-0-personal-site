		<h3>Why?</h3>
		<p><em>Who knows and who cares?</em></p>
		<p>Apparently, sitting still isn't a hobby, but embroidery is as close as you can get to simultaneously doing something and nothing, so here it is. This site will show you some basic embroidery techniques and a few examples that would make Sartre... probably not care all that much.</p>

				<td>I was originally inspired by <a href="http://sublimestitching.com/pages/tutorials">Sublime Stitching</a>. Although the content is strong and the layout is clean, I think the layout feels a bit outdated and certain functions are a bit invasive.</td>
			</tr>
			<tr>
				<td>If you happen to shop the site, your shopping cart will push the site layout over. Since the cart layout isn't particularly stylish, it's kind of an ugly item to fix on the screen.</td>
			</tr>
			<tr>
				<td>I like that descriptions appear over the products when you hover over them with your cursor.</td>
			</tr>
			<tr>
				<td>I think it's interesting that the description portion in the beginning uses a table for the text/image. I tried it too! But I wonder if it wouldn't be the same if I were to use stylized divs to achieve the same effect?</td>
